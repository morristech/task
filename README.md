# Task

The given application can view, create and delete notes. However, from an engineering perspective
it contains many flaws. Try to find problematic pieces in the code and fix them. Don’t look for
specific bugs and don’t focus on the UI. Pay more attention to the business logic. You’re free to
choose any framework and library that you think are helpful to solve the issues. If you detect
problems but time is running out, then please add a comment so that it can be discussed later. You
can also commit changes in the local repository to see specific changes in isolation.
